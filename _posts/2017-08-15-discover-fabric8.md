  ## A journey
  Every day there is a new framework being created, another framework becoming more popular and the one framework you picked getting deprecated

Here comes the day where you decide to do some microservice development. You heard about Kubernetes, you know about Docker, you're skilled in Java,you like Spring Boot right or Node.js but you don't know where to start. Easy just google [`spring boot kubernetes`](https://www.google.com/search?q=spring+boot+kubernetes). If only it was that simple.

So I did that.

Two of the first ten links refer to [Fabric8](https://fabric8.io/) and one goes to a comprehensive document about [Spring and Fabric8](https://spring.fabric8.io/) development. Fabric8 is described as an Integrated Development Platform for Kubernetes:

> fabric8 is an end to end development platform spanning ideation to production for the creation of cloud native applications and microservices. You can build, test and deploy your applications via Continuous Delivery pipelines then run and manage them with Continuous Improvement and ChatOps

I'm intrigued. Will this make my life easier? at what cost?
